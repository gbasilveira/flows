## Quick Example

```typescript
import { createFlows, createWorkflow, StorageType } from 'flows';

// Configure the workflow engine
const config = {
  storage: {
    type: StorageType.MEMORY,
  },
  logging: {
    level: 'info',
  },
};

// Create the workflow executor
const flows = createFlows(config);

// Define your workflow
const workflow = createWorkflow('my-workflow', 'My First Workflow', [
  {
    id: 'start',
    type: 'data',
    inputs: { message: 'Hello, World!' },
    dependencies: [],
  },
  {
    id: 'process',
    type: 'data',
    inputs: { result: 'processed' },
    dependencies: ['start'],
  },
]);

// Execute the workflow
const result = await flows.startWorkflow(workflow);
console.log('Workflow completed:', result);
```

## Why Flows?

Flows addresses the unique challenges of building complex, stateful workflows in frontend applications:

- **No Backend Required**: Run sophisticated workflows entirely in the browser
- **State Persistence**: Workflows survive page reloads and can be resumed
- **Event-Driven**: React to user interactions, API responses, or external events
- **Failure Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery strategies
- **Developer Experience**: TypeScript support, great tooling, and clear APIs

## What Makes It Different?

Unlike server-side workflow engines, Flows is built specifically for frontend applications:

- **Lightweight**: Small bundle size optimised for browsers
- **Storage Flexibility**: Works with localStorage, remote APIs, or in-memory
- **Frontend Events**: Seamlessly integrate with DOM events, user interactions
- **Security**: Browser-friendly security model with configurable restrictions
- **Performance**: Optimised for UI responsiveness and user experience

## Enterprise Features

Flows includes enterprise-grade features typically found only in server-side solutions:

- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevent cascading failures
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Handle and retry failed operations
- **Poison Message Detection**: Automatically quarantine problematic workflows
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and alerting
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue operating with reduced functionality

## Get Started in Minutes

1. **Install**: `npm install flows`
2. **Configure**: Choose your storage and options
3. **Create**: Define your workflow with simple JavaScript objects
4. **Execute**: Start your workflow and handle results
